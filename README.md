First Person Shooter with zombies. 
You can change weapons by pressing "Q" (you have 2 available: a shotgun and 2 uzis), each one of these guns has a different animation as well as a different fire rate (and damage), however, they don't have muzzle flash. 
The enemy detects you when entering a certain range, you can see the enemy's healthbar when you point at them with the gun, they are also pushed back when you shoot them and they take damage. Of course, they can also damage you. 
You can reload the gun by pressing "R" (but it has no animation) and you can also take ammo by pressing "E" around the ammo pack. 
There is also a minimap at the left corner of the screen, you can see the enemies as a red square and yourself as a green square.
